Predicting link formation in online settings is one of the most critical tasks data scientists have to deal with. In fact, link formation dynamics help to solve several business problems, such as:

+ explaining the popularity of products in online marketplaces
+ building recommender systems (see last year final course project)
+ placing ads (e.g., ads concerning job posts) in the right spot so as to maximise the returns and attract more 'customers'

For this final course project, groups are required to analyze the Stackoverflow setting and to address the following question: Why do users participate in certain threads â€“ i.e. reply to certain questions?
