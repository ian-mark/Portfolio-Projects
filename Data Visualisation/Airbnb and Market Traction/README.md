Digital technologies have transformed the organization and functioning of
several markets. The pervasive diffusion of mobile devices along with
computational innovations (e.g. machine learning, deep learning, AI) have
created the opportunities for new ventures to emerge and challenge the
leadership of incumbents. Such a process has produced new business models (e.g.
the 'platform' business model) and new forms of arrangement of economic and
social exchange (e.g. the sharing economy). 

For the final course project, groups are supposed to create a [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) dashboard
that illustrates the competition between incumbents and challengers of a market.

+ Airbnb Vs. Hotels in the NYC borough of Manhattan

The **audience** for this chart is the association of Manhattan hotels (depending on your choice). The
members of the association have the following information needs:

+ how competitors gain market traction over time;
+ which areas of Manhattan (hotels Vs. Airbnb) have been affected the most.

The chart is meant to serve both exploration and presentations goals â€“ the
leaders of the industry association will use it to:
+ understand how fierce competition is in their sector;
+ possibly, to conduct lobbying activities/getting a more favorable regulation of the market.
