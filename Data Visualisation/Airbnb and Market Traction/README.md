Final Course Project Description
================================

Digital technologies have transformed the organization and functioning of
several markets. The pervasive diffusion of mobile devices along with
computational innovations (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, AI) have
created the opportunities for new ventures to emerge and challenge the
leadership of incumbents. Such a process has produced new business models (e.g.,
the 'platform' business model) and new forms of arrangement of economic and
social exchange (e.g., the sharing economy). 

For their final course project, groups are supposed to create a [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) dashboard
that illustrates the competition between incumbents and challengers of a market.
There are two alternative settings in which students can carry-out their
project:

+ Uber Vs. Yellow Taxis in NYC
+ Airbnb Vs. Hotels in the NYC borough of Manhattan

The **audience** for this chart is the industry association of the yellow taxi
drivers or the association of Manhattan hotels (depending on your choice). The
members of these two associations have common information needs – they want to get a closer understanding of the following:

+ how competitors have get market traction over time;
+ which areas of NYC (yellow taxi drivers Vs. Uber) or Manhattan (hotels Vs.
    Airbnb) have been affected the most.

The chart is meant to serve both exploration and presentations goals – the
leaders of the two industry associations will use it (i) to understand how
fierce competition is in their sector; (ii) possibly, to conduct lobbying
activities/getting a more favorable regulation of the market.
